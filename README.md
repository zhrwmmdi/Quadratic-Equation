# Quadratic-Equation
This is a program that solves any QUADRATIC EQUATION, it doesn't matter if DELTA is positive, zero or negative. It can also solve a quadaric equatioan that its answers are COMPLEX NUMBERS. A quadratic equation is in the form of { ax^2 + bx + c = 0} , and the program asks the user to enter a, b and c and then calculates its answer(s).
First instantiate an object from Methods class in order to be able to use the methods and then call the getItems() method, The program output is like this:

		Enter a, b and c in the target quadratic equation:
		1 -7 12
		Your target equation is +1.00 x^2 -7.00 x +12.00 = 0
		The answers are	x1 = 4.00	x2 = 3.00

or like this:

		Enter a, b and c in the target quadratic equation:
 		4 5 8
		Your target equation is +4.00 x^2 +5.00 x +8.00 = 0
		The answers are	x1 = -0.63 + 20.297783i	x2 = -0.63 - 20.297783i

or like this:

		Enter a, b and c in the target quadratic equation:
		1 4 4
		Your target equation is +1.00 x^2 +4.00 x +4.00 = 0
		The answer is	x = -2.00
